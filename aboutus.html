        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>
            With innovative approaches and advanced methodologies, Vecta Corp. provides scalable business solutions to help companies achieve success<br> through revenue increase, cost management and user satisfaction.</p>

        <p>Our approach stems from the three most important business growth aspects: helping companies reach prospects, assist in converting prospects to<br> customers, and assist in retaining those customers. This is accomplished through our interactive
            solutions and expertise in providing a memorable and<br> positive user experience.</p>

        <p>In order to effectively prospect, convert and retain, the user experience is placed at the center of all our development projects. Providing unique,<br> memorable and positive experiences, striking the appropriate emotional connection and reducing
            mental effort required to interact with the site<br> ultimately results in higher prospect conversion and customer retention figures.</p>

        <p>Our expertise in strategy, design and technology allows us to create business solutions that excite and inspire, are easy to navigate, and enable<br> businesses to strengthen their competitive advantage.</p>

        <p>With increased conversion and retention, our solutions provide companies with opportunities to increase revenues and enhance productivity. This is<br> how we helped Dorknozzle achieve remarkable success, including more than doubling their customer
            base from 20,000 to 70,000 within 15 months<br> of launching a Vecta Corp. solution.</p>
